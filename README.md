# Scream-Secrets-2024

Repository for submission to the [Scream Secrets 2024 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/scream-secrets/rate/2932954)!

This was a collaborative project built in Unreal, with C++, blueprints, and original art/sound assets. Not all code is my own. My contribution was backend programming, gameplay programming, and all sound.

This is a fork of the project's state on submission to the game jam. The active development version is [here](https://github.com/Archives0/Final-Feast).
